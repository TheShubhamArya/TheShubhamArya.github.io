            A new way to play the same old game. Hand cricket is a game played by many school kids for fun. It uses the concepts of cricket and played with
            hands. Hand Cricket is a game in which two players show scores on their respective fingers. If the scores are equal, the batsman is declared out.
            Else, the score of the batsman is added to the total runs of the batting team.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hand Cricket will let you relive your past and provide you an enhanced experience with all the different and innovative features. There are 30
            different combinations of formats ranging from 1 wicket and 1 over to 10 wickets and unlimited overs. This variety lets you choose and play with
            your favorite settings. Don't like to bowl? The target feature lets you set a target and play without bowling. There is something in it for
            everyone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Playing this game is simple, fast, and convenient. Just tap as fast or as slow as you wish, and the game would be played at your speed. You no

        <h2 id="about" class="description-heading">About</h2>
          <p>
            This game is a tribute to one of my favorite childhood games Hand Cricket. I have played this game for more than a decade, and I am pretty sure
            everyone in the Indian subcontinent would have heard or played this game at least once. Playing this game in person required a lot of coordination
            as well as quick mental math to keep track of runs and wickets, and did I mention that it was fun to play? So to bring back those childhood
            memories, I have created the Hand Cricket App. This game is just like how you used to play it but even better! With the Hand Cricket app,
            you can do way more than just keeping track of your score. You can find your strike rate, average, runs to win, coins, your rank, and many more
            things. You also have a chance to be on the very prestigious leaderboard top 50. You can also share your results, statistics, and your name on
            the leaderboard with your friends! I have redefined the way people used to play this game with their fingers before, compared to the way they
            play this game with their fingers now.
  ​        </p>
          <p>
            Making this game had its challenge as your opponent, computer, isn't as smart as you. A computer could see the pattern of your numbers but
            couldn't possibly predict the number you are going to put. For this reason, a coin system was introduced so that users refrain from putting
            the same high scoring numbers like 5 and 6 to win the game. The coin system allowed us to penalize users for putting the same high scoring
            number again and again. However, the game also favors the users by rewarding them with more points when they mix the numbers they put while
            batting and bowling. From playing it in real life to playing it on your mobile, there is going to be a big difference because of the lack
            of human element. But at the same time, users will experience a new innovative way to play the same old game. I hope the fun remains and
            you get the same joy while playing it on the app as when you used to play it with your friends.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you aren't familiar with cricket or hand cricket, I highly suggest you to take a look at the rules of cricket and hand cricket at the
            bottom of this page. Go on, I am waiting. Now that you have read about the rules (if you still haven't , READ IT) and know all about wickets,
            overs and runs , let's get started. Okay, okay for the people who are too lazy, let me explain it briefly.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Runs- This is a unit of scoring. Basically like 'points' for people with no cricketing background.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wickets- This is a really good way to prevent opponents from scoring. It is sort of like 'lives' in a game. If you pick all the wickets,
                then the opponent can't score any runs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Overs- This is a limiting factor for the game. If you don't get all the wickets of the opponent, the only thing that stops the opponent
                from scoring is the overs. When the opponent has completed batting all the overs, they can't score anymore. An over has 6 balls and you
                can choose the number of overs you want to play in Hand Cricket. If you decide to choose the 'test' option, then there will be unlimited
                overs. This means that you will have to get all wickets of the opponent to prevent him from scoring.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            All right, your first step should be to open the app :) and you'll be presented with the Home page with a 'Create Account' button and a 'Game'
            button. Tap on the 'Create Account' button and create your account or sign in. I highly recommend you to sign in so that you can compete with
            others for the top ranks on the leaderboard and look at your statistics. Once you have signed in, you will reach the page with all game choices.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this page, you can see your rank and coins at the very top. Below that, you will see a wickets option (i.e. lives) and the overs option
            (i.e limiting factor). If you are very new to this, start off by 1 wicket and 1 over as the settings. You can also choose the wickets all the
            way to 10 and overs all the way to 'test'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now it is time to decide who will score first (i.e bat). Tap on the coin to toss the coin, or alternatively shake your phone to toss the coin.
            The computer would randomly generate either a bat or a ball. If a bat appears, you are batting first (i.e scoring first) and if a ball appears
            you will bowl first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now you may see an option for target. This option is only to score runs. This means that you don't have to bowl, and you can just score runs.
            It is very important to note that you will not be awarded any coins if you play in this mode so you should only use it to practice.
            Now the only thing left for you to do is to click on the play button or swipe right.

            Congratulations! You have reached the playing mode. Finally! Observe the screen carefully. The bottom part has six buttons. The number of fingers
            on the button represents the number of points you will get. A thumb represents 6 runs here. Above these buttons, you will also see a 'Computer'
            and a 'Result'. The 'Computer' region tells you what the computer played and the 'Result' region tells you the outcome. Now let me give you an
            example to explain it clearly.​
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's say you picked 1 wicket and 1 over in the previous page. You shook your phone and the coin flipped and it landed on a bat. This means that
            you are going to score first. You clicked on the play button and now you're on the playing screen.  Go ahead and click 5 (🤚). If the computer
            played something other than 5 like 1 (☝️), then you scored 5 runs which will be displayed in the 'Result' region. Your score on the scoreboard is
            '5-0' right now. 5 representing the runs scored, and 0 for the number of wickets lost. Let's say you put a 6 (👍) and the computer put 2 (✌️),
            then you scored 6 more runs. Now your total on the score board is 11-0 and you have played 0.2 overs out of 1 over. Remember an over has 6 balls
            so you have 4 more balls left. Let's say you put a ☝️ and the computer also put ☝️. You lose your wicket because both put the same number.
            Now, since you were only playing a 1 wicket game, you have lost all your wickets and your turn to score runs is overs. Now, on the playing screen,
            you can see that there is a target of 12 on the screen (your score + 1). This is the number of runs computer needs to win. So now, it is your
            time to bowl and computer's time to bat. The computer randomly plays 1,1,1,2,4,1 while you bowl 6,6,6,4,5,2. If you sum up the computer's runs,
            you get 10 (1+1+1+2+4+1). Good job Kevin! The computer cannot score anymore runs now because all the overs are completed. As you can see, you
            scored 11-1 in 0.3 overs and computed scored 10-0 in 1 over. This means that you won by 1 run!
          </p>
          <p>
            If in this example, the computer ended up scoring 12-0 in 1 over, it would win. If computer scored 9-1 in 1 over, it would lose. If the computer
            scored 11-0 or 11-1 in 1 over, then the match would be tied. Phew! That was a long explanation, but if you have followed me right through
            the end, then you should be good enough to get started. Otherwise, I suggest you to watch some videos online or play more on the app to get
            a hang of it. Until then, tap tap tap.

                        Best- Your highest score while batting in a match. If you have 2 scores with the same best score, then the score with lesser number of

                        Strike Rate- This is (total runs/ total balls)*100. This means that if you faced 100 balls or (16.4 overs) you are likely to score that
                        many runs. For example, let’s say your SR is 330.17. This means that if you played a 100 balls, you’re likely to score around 330 runs
                      provided you don't lose all your wickets. This can also be used to calculate how many runs you score on each ball by dividing your strike
                      rate by 100. If your strike rate was 330.17, then you approximately score 3.3 runs per ball. This data helps you understand how many runs
                        you usually score. A higher strike rate, for example 500, suggests that you usually put 4s,5s, and 6s more than any number.

                        Average- This is runs/wickets. This lets you know the average runs you score for each wicket. Let’s say you scored 289-10 in a match
                        while batting.  This means that your average is (289/10) 28.9. If you scored 47-3 in a game, your average would be (47/3) 15.67
                        runs/wicket. Your average also tells you how many runs you might score. For instance, if your average is 19.38 and you’re playing a
                        5 wicket game, you will score around 19.38x5 = 97  (average x total wickets) runs. This calculation is however limited by the number of
                        overs you're playing.

                        Best- The lowest score you have got the opponent out for and picking the most number of wickets while bowling. If you got your opponent
                        out for 46-10 in 1 game and you also got them out for 48-10 in another game, then, 46-10 would be considered as the best while bowling.
                        This is true even if the score was 45-5 as you have still picked more wickets in 46-10.

                        Strike Rate- This is  balls/wicket while bowling. Note that bowling strike rate is different from batting strike rate. So if your bowling
                        strike rate is 5.85, it takes an average off 5.85 balls for you to pick a wicket. A lower strike rate is a good indicator of how quickly
                        you can get your opponent out.

                        Average- This is the number of runs you concede while bowling per wicket or runs/wicket. If your bowling average is 16.21, then you concede
                        16.21 runs before you pick a wicket. A lower strike rate is also a good indicator and tells how economical you are while bowling

                    We have set up a coin system that discourages users from repeating the same number again and again. So, to encourage people from putting
                    different number while playing, we have set a certain constant value to each number. We of course cannot give how much each number is valued
                    as it will make users put that number more often than the other numbers. But if you’re willing to earn more coins, I highly suggest you to mix
                    up the numbers both while batting and bowling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The format of the match, i.e., the number of overs and wickets for a game also decides your coins. A shorter game with lesser wickets is given
                    lesser points compared to a longer game with more wickets. Users should also note that there is a penalty for format mismatch. Format mismatch
                    is basically when a user decides to play a game and sets the format such that it benefits them. For instance, if a user decides to play a 1 over
                    game with 10 wickets, they will be penalized with points reduction. This is because if you were playing in that format, you would be more likely
                    to win as you’d have more wickets to depend on. A good practice to have is to keep the number of wickets and overs identical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Points are added for matches won and tied, and reduced for matches lost. If you want to maximize your coins, you should play in the 'Test'
                    mode with 10 wickets. The advantage of playing in this mode is that you get additional points for your 'Net Average'. Net average is
                    (your average while batting) - (your average while bowling). This net average can boost your coins in a match by almost 6 coins per game.
                    Players should also note that while this format leads to more coins, it also can result in loss of more coins when you lose.
