        <p>
          A new way to play the same old game. Hand cricket is a game played by many school kids for fun. It uses the concepts of cricket and played with
          hands. Hand Cricket is a game in which two players show scores on their respective fingers. If the scores are equal, the batsman is declared out.
          Else, the score of the batsman is added to the total runs of the batting team.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hand Cricket will let you relive your past and provide you an enhanced experience with all the different and innovative features. There are 30
          different combinations of formats ranging from 1 wicket and 1 over to 10 wickets and unlimited overs. This variety lets you choose and play with
          your favorite settings. Don't like to bowl? The target feature lets you set a target and play without bowling. There is something in it for
          everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Playing this game is simple, fast, and convenient. Just tap as fast or as slow as you wish, and the game would be played at your speed. You no
          longer have to wait for your friends to put a number while they think! The scoreboard provides all the information you need to succeed. From
          your score to the strike rates and averages, there are all the statistics you would want. A cricketer's dream for real. Play with a lively
          experience and the touch of tapping a real button with the haptic feedback which vibrates according to the number you play. Tapping is definitely
          more fun now.

      <h4 id="list-item-2">About</h4>
        <p>
          This game is a tribute to one of my favorite childhood games Hand Cricket. I have played this game for more than a decade, and I am pretty sure
          everyone in the Indian subcontinent would have heard or played this game at least once. Playing this game in person required a lot of coordination
          as well as quick mental math to keep track of runs and wickets, and did I mention that it was fun to play? So to bring back those childhood
          memories, I have created the Hand Cricket App. This game is just like how you used to play it but even better! With the Hand Cricket app,
          you can do way more than just keeping track of your score. You can find your strike rate, average, runs to win, coins, your rank, and many more
          things. You also have a chance to be on the very prestigious leaderboard top 50. You can also share your results, statistics, and your name on
          the leaderboard with your friends! I have redefined the way people used to play this game with their fingers before, compared to the way they
          play this game with their fingers now.
​        </p>
        <p>
          Making this game had its challenge as your opponent, computer, isn't as smart as you. A computer could see the pattern of your numbers but
          couldn't possibly predict the number you are going to put. For this reason, a coin system was introduced so that users refrain from putting
          the same high scoring numbers like 5 and 6 to win the game. The coin system allowed us to penalize users for putting the same high scoring
          number again and again. However, the game also favors the users by rewarding them with more points when they mix the numbers they put while
          batting and bowling. From playing it in real life to playing it on your mobile, there is going to be a big difference because of the lack
          of human element. But at the same time, users will experience a new innovative way to play the same old game. I hope the fun remains and
          you get the same joy while playing it on the app as when you used to play it with your friends.
        </p>

      <h4 id="list-item-3">How to play</h4>
        <p>
          If you aren't familiar with cricket or hand cricket, I highly suggest you to take a look at the rules of cricket and hand cricket at the
          bottom of this page. Go on, I am waiting. Now that you have read about the rules (if you still haven't , READ IT) and know all about wickets,
          overs and runs , let's get started. Okay, okay for the people who are too lazy, let me explain it briefly.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Runs- This is a unit of scoring. Basically like 'points' for people with no cricketing background.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wickets- This is a really good way to prevent opponents from scoring. It is sort of like 'lives' in a game. If you pick all the wickets,
              then the opponent can't score any runs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Overs- This is a limiting factor for the game. If you don't get all the wickets of the opponent, the only thing that stops the opponent
              from scoring is the overs. When the opponent has completed batting all the overs, they can't score anymore. An over has 6 balls and you
              can choose the number of overs you want to play in Hand Cricket. If you decide to choose the 'test' option, then there will be unlimited
              overs. This means that you will have to get all wickets of the opponent to prevent him from scoring.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          All right, your first step should be to open the app :) and you'll be presented with the Home page with a 'Create Account' button and a 'Game'
          button. Tap on the 'Create Account' button and create your account or sign in. I highly recommend you to sign in so that you can compete with
          others for the top ranks on the leaderboard and look at your statistics. Once you have signed in, you will reach the page with all game choices.

          In this page, you can see your rank and coins at the very top. Below that, you will see a wickets option (i.e. lives) and the overs option
          (i.e limiting factor). If you are very new to this, start off by 1 wicket and 1 over as the settings. You can also choose the wickets all the
          way to 10 and overs all the way to 'test'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is time to decide who will score first (i.e bat). Tap on the coin to toss the coin, or alternatively shake your phone to toss the coin.
          The computer would randomly generate either a bat or a ball. If a bat appears, you are batting first (i.e scoring first) and if a ball appears
          you will bowl first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you may see an option for target. This option is only to score runs. This means that you don't have to bowl, and you can just score runs.
          It is very important to note that you will not be awarded any coins if you play in this mode so you should only use it to practice.
          Now the only thing left for you to do is to click on the play button or swipe right.

          Congratulations! You have reached the playing mode. Finally! Observe the screen carefully. The bottom part has six buttons. The number of fingers
          on the button represents the number of points you will get. A thumb represents 6 runs here. Above these buttons, you will also see a 'Computer'
          and a 'Result'. The 'Computer' region tells you what the computer played and the 'Result' region tells you the outcome. Now let me give you an
          example to explain it clearly.​
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's say you picked 1 wicket and 1 over in the previous page. You shook your phone and the coin flipped and it landed on a bat. This means that
          you are going to score first. You clicked on the play button and now you're on the playing screen.  Go ahead and click 5 (🤚). If the computer
          played something other than 5 like 1 (☝️), then you scored 5 runs which will be displayed in the 'Result' region. Your score on the scoreboard is
          '5-0' right now. 5 representing the runs scored, and 0 for the number of wickets lost. Let's say you put a 6 (👍) and the computer put 2 (✌️),
          then you scored 6 more runs. Now your total on the score board is 11-0 and you have played 0.2 overs out of 1 over. Remember an over has 6 balls
          so you have 4 more balls left. Let's say you put a ☝️ and the computer put ☝️ too. You now lost your wicket. Now, since you were only playing a 1
          wicket game, you have lost all your wickets and your turn to score runs is overs. Now, on the playing screen, you can see that there is a target
          of 12 on the screen (your score + 1). This is the number of runs computer needs to win. So now, it is your time to bowl and computer's time to
          bat. The computer randomly plays 1,1,1,2,4,1 while you bowl 6,6,6,4,5,2. If you sum up the computer's runs, you get 10 (1+1+1+2+4+1).
          Good job Kevin! The computer cannot score anymore runs now because all the overs are completed. As you can see, you scored 11-1 in 0.3 overs
          and computed scored 10-0 in 1 over. This means that you won by 1 run!
        </p>
        <p>
          If in this example, the computer ended up scoring 12-0 in 1 over, it would win. If computer scored 9-1 in 1 over, it would lose. If the computer
          scored 11-0 or 11-1 in 1 over, then the match would be tied. Phew! That was a long explanation, but if you have followed me right through
          the end, then you should be good enough to get started. Otherwise, I suggest you to watch some videos online or play more on the app to get
          a hang of it. Until then, tap tap tap.

      Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ee-) is a multilingual open-collaborative online encyclopedia created and maintained by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system. It is one of the 15 most popular websites as ranked by Alexa, as of August 2020.[3] Featuring no advertisements, it is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.

    Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined its name[4][5] as a portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia". It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed. With 6.2 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 55 million articles[6] attracting 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.[7][8]

    Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias, with the majority of editors being male. Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[9] In 2006 Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[10] The project's reputation improved further in the 2010s as it increased efforts to improve its quality and reliability. In 2018 Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.

      Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ee-) is a multilingual open-collaborative online encyclopedia created and maintained by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system. It is one of the 15 most popular websites as ranked by Alexa, as of August 2020.[3] Featuring no advertisements, it is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.

    Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined its name[4][5] as a portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia". It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed. With 6.2 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 55 million articles[6] attracting 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.[7][8]

    Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias, with the majority of editors being male. Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[9] In 2006 Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[10] The project's reputation improved further in the 2010s as it increased efforts to improve its quality and reliability. In 2018 Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.
