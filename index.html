                        As a computer scientist, I aspire to build applications that millions of people can use to make the
                        world a more sustainable, habitable, and happier place to live.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 22 years, I have had the pleasure to learn many things, meet extraordinary people, and travel
                        around the world. This website captures a fraction of my work and experiences that should help you
                        to know me better. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am no prodigy, but I am someone who is inspired easily. I look at things that fascinate me, and
                        I get motivated to do something better than that. I have this innate quality to learn a concept
                        rapidly and then apply that to practical use. For instance, I was motivated to develop apps that
                        people could use globally. Within two months, I accomplished this feat when I pushed my first app
                        on the App Store.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While I have had my fair share of success, I don't mind occasional failures. I believe that failures
                        improve a person that makes them a better problem solver for the future. When I encounter such
                        difficult situations, I have a greater drive to succeed. For example, after I had to decline an
                        internship from Apple due to coronavirus in the summer of 2021, I was impelled to create my third 
                        app, through which I gained some advanced skills that I may not have otherwise.

                                    of topics. I mastered completely programmatic UI with <b>Money-Wise</b>

                    <p>
                        I have worked in over seven different programming languages for numerous projects and assignments.
                        I have excelled in <b>Swift, Python, C, and C++</b> the most. The language I like to work on the most
                        is Swift as it allows readability. However, I have 5+ years of experience in C++ as it was the first 
                        language I learned.

                <h4 class="item-title">Database</h4>
                <p>
                    My first experience with the database was with SQL in my senior year of high school. Since then, 
                    I have worked with databases like Firebase Firestore and MySQL to perform database functionality 
                    for projects. I have also used SQLite in my mobile applications to store users' data using the 
                    native CoreData framework.

                <h4 class="item-title">UI / UX Design</h4>
                <p>
                    Having designed three mobile applications and this website, I understand the user interface and user 
                    experience concepts that provide the users the best experience. I am familiar with HTML and CSS that 
                    I used to design this website. I like to design my apps programmatically with frameworks like UIKit and 
                    swiftUI.

                    I enjoy working with people who love what they do. I would be glad to collaborate on ideas or project for someone who strive for bigger things.
                    Let's work together and build something awesome!
