                        As a computer scientist, I aspire to build applications that millions of people around the world
                        can use to make the world a more sustainable, habitable and happier place to live.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In just 22 years on this planet, I have had the pleasure to learn some interesting things, meet 
                        extraordinary people, and visit amazing places around the world. This website captures a fraction of 
                        my  work and experiences which should help you to get to know me better. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am no prodigy but I am someone who is inspired easily. I look at a thing that fascinates me and I get motivated to
                        do something better than that. I have this innate quality to learn a concept rapidly and then 
                        apply that in a practical use. For instance, I was motivated to develop my own apps that people
                        could use globally. In just 2 months, I was able to accomplish this feat when I pushed my first app 
                        on the App Store.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While I have had my fair share of success, I don't mind occassional failures. I believe that the 
                        learning I get through my failures provides me a far greater understanding of the situation which
                        makes me a better problem solver for the future. Moreover, I have a greater drive to succeed when I 
                        encounter difficulties. For example, after I had to decline an intenrship from Apple due to 
                        coronavirus in summer of 2021, I was impelled to create my third app for the App Store through which
                        I gained some advanced skills that I may not have otherwise.
